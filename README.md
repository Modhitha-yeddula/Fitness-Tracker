Fitness Tracker :
A machine learning-powered fitness tracker that predicts calories burned and classifies fitness levels based on user activity.

Project Overview:
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression) to analyze exercise data, heart rate, BMI, and workout duration to:

. Predict calories burned based on user input.

. Classify users' fitness levels into beginner, intermediate, or advanced.

. Recommend workouts based on fitness level.

. Visualize progress using interactive graphs.

 System Architecture:
1. User Input: Age, Gender, Heart Rate, BMI, Workout Duration, etc.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, Normalization, Feature Engineering.

3. Machine Learning Models
   
 . Regression for Calorie Burn Prediction.

 . Classification for Fitness Level Categorization.

Output & Recommendations: Results displayed via Streamlit Web App.

Tech Stack
.Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

.Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression)

.Streamlit (for Web Interface)

.Google Fit API (future integration plan)
